# Campusfi

Campusfi is a desktop-based application that streamlines the process of requesting Wi-Fi access in colleges. 
Traditionally, students were required to fill out a physical form and submit it to the concerned staff in person. 
This project eliminates the manual process by allowing students to submit their laptop MAC addresses through a user-friendly interface, enabling college administrators to view and approve requests efficiently.
